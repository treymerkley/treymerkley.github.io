    <h1>404</h1>
<h2>I think it's time to go back.</h2>
 <p>
  When I was a boy, my dad and I would go for long, aimless drives on the old, dusty roads that wind rural Oklahoma.
  We would drive for hours, talking about nothing, watching the gnarled trees and delapidated trailers pass us by, the
  forlorn product of a land left forgotten.</br>
  </br>
  One hot, dry Summer day, when I was about 14, as we were going to the truck stop on the hill, we saw clouds of smoke rising lazily towards
  the sky. It was a Sunday afternoon when neither of us had anything better to do, so we both grabbed our snacks and
  started driving towards the smoke. We took a circuitous route that led us to dead end after dead end, talking about
  things like Kafka and how work had been going, school for me and the a desk job for him.
  </br>
  </br>
  After road, after road, after road, chasing the smoke on the horizon endlessly, farther than we intended but with a deep
  longing for the satisfaction that only the blaze we sought would quell, we finally found the singed remains of fields
  devoured. We followed the trail as far as we could, only to find ourselves beyond a single lane bridge, at sundown,
  a yard or two away from the home of a stranger where the trail end. my dad looked at the sun, and the bridge, and at me,
  and with a wry chuckle, said <strong><a href="">"I think it's time to go back."</a></strong> Begrudgingly, we turned around in the stranger's yard and made
  our way home, and while we never got to see the fire itself, I think the journey there was what made it all worthwhile.
